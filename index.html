                <p>There are those who cannot get through the day without having at
                    least one coffee. And, of course many of you who appreciate this
                    beverage will appreciate it in an cool establishment, which has
                    a great design and an excellent decoration to make your expresso
                    even more amazing.
                    Coffee-houses in seventeenth-century London, from the first that
                    opened there in 1652, were modelled on similar businesses in Ottoman
                    territories. In London they encouraged an open form of public debate,
                    much celebrated in contemporary literary writing and visual
                    representations, and also in models of the public sphere in the
                    twentieth century. The paper examines the representation of these
                    seventeenth-century discussions and debates, discussing how such
                    conversations were considered to be both open and unfettered, and
                    yet also channelled and regulated into particular forms by unstated
                    expectations. Such regulatory mechanisms are reinforced by the
                    coffee-houses notorious exclusion of women from their debates.</p>

            <h2>About Us...</h2>
            <p>It is here, at No 25/2 Ranwala junction Kegalle, that our adventure
                began in 2018. Originally the reception of the green coffee, the
                roasting and the service were operated from the place we took. It
                is still today our flagship and the place where the essence of
                Coutume is expressed.</p>
            <p>It is precisely the place of all our experiences. You can daily
                taste several coffees of different origins in espresso and filter,
                get your favorite coffee beans or ground on demand by our barista
                depending on your extraction method. The espresso-based drinks
                are all made manually on our superb groups.</p>
            <p>Breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon tea and homemade pastries ...
                We do everything in our power to make you enjoy a moment of pleasure
                and indulgence in peace. The sweet menu is created by Véronique Ung,
                our pastry chef for more than 2 years. Our savory menu is the work
                of our chef and his team.</p>
